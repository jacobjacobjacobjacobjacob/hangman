# hangman
simple, text-based hangman game. my first python project.

the main goal of the project was learning how to work with loops, functions and flow of a simple program. 

the program is run by just running the hangman.py file

future things to add:
- get the random word from a custom (external) file, e.g. a .csv-file.
- add multiple players (chose a name, make a high score or similar)
- add simple graphics to the game
